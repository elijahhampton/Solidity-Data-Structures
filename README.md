There are many implementations of data structures in Solidity.  This repository is an attempt to consolidate those implementations and store my own. Feel free to contribute.  All PRs welcome.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

npm install
```
```sh
npm run test
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Change these implementations to fit your use case.  

<!-- ROADMAP -->
